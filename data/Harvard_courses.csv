Genomic features are generally identified using intervals in genomic coordinates, and highly efficient algorithms for computing with genomic intervals will be examined in detail. Statistical methods for testing gene-centric or pathway-centric hypotheses with genome-scale data are found in packages such as limma, some of these techniques will be illustrated in lectures and labs.",edX

Using knitr and rmarkdown as basic authoring tools, the concept of reproducible research is developed, and the concept of an executable document is presented. In this framework reports are linked tightly to the underlying data and code, enhancing reproducibility and extensibility of completed analyses. We study out-of-memory approaches to the analysis of very large data resources, using relational databases or HDF5 as ""back ends"" with familiar R interfaces. Multiomic data integration is illustrated using a curated version of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, we explore cloud-resident resources developed for the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the ENCODE project).

Finally, we cover RNA-seq at the transcript-level : inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples.

But the states of the former Confederacy devised ways to evade this prohibition, and beginning in 1890 they adopted new constitutions that effectively disfranchised Black Americans for 75 years. With few exceptions, Congress and the Supreme Court did not interfere. Not until the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 did the Fifteenth Amendment come alive, vigorously enforced by the US Department of Justice and upheld by the court. But the tide has turned in the twenty-first century. The Supreme Court in 2013 nullified a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, enabling states to impose new impediments on access to the polls in 2022 and to dilute minority voting strength through partisan redistricting (gerrymandering). We examine the history of race and voting rights in US law, from antebellum laws and the Fifteenth Amendment to the Voting Rights Act, and the retreat from those rights by Congress and the Supreme Court, first in the era of Jim Crow and again now.
