# Project-Savo-by-The-Quantums
Savo aims to provide a one-stop solution to one of the most prominent problems which exists amongst the college/school students, i.e. Which online certification course would be the best suited for them? Often, it is confusing for students to figure out which course they want to take up when there are about millions of them available online and tons of instructors teaching the very same topic.  That's where we come in! Savo would provide the target audience with a single platform that helps them to compare different courses available online on the same topic based on specific filters. No more would it be a hassle for students to get the right kind of guidance in choosing a course once they get their hands on Savo.
